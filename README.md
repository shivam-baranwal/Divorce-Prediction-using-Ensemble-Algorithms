Within the scope of this research, the divorce prediction was carried out by using the Divorce Predictors Scale (DPS) on the basis of Gottman couples therapy. Of the participants, 84 (49%) were divorced and 86 (51%) were married couples. Participants completed the “Personal Information Form” and “Divorce Predictors Scale”. In this study, the success of DPS, was investigated using Gradient Boosting and AdaBoost algorithms.
